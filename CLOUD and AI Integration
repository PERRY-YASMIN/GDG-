DIVING INTO CLOUD IOT CORE INTEGRATION AND AI DEVELOPMENT
 
*Cloud IoT Core Integration:*
1. *Device Registration:* Bin sensors and cameras registered on Cloud IoT Core
2. *Data Ingestion:* Sensor data (fill levels, waste types) and camera feeds ingested into:
 - *Cloud Storage (Bucket: smartwaste-sensors)*
 - *Cloud Pub/Sub (Topic: smartwaste-telemetry)*
3. *Device Management:* Cloud IoT Core manages bin device firmware updates and configuration

*AI Development:*
1. *Machine Learning Model:* Built on *Cloud AI Platform* to predict:
 - Bin fill levels
 - Waste arrival times
 - Optimal pickup schedules
2. *Model Training:* Using historical sensor data (*Cloud Storage bucket: smartwaste-historical*) and labeled datasets.
3. *Model Deployment:* Trained model deployed as *Cloud Function (smartwaste-prediction)* triggered by new sensor data.

*Integration Touchpoints:*
- Cloud IoT Core -> Cloud Functions -> Cloud AI Platform
- Cloud Pub/Sub -> Cloud Storage -> Cloud AI Platform
