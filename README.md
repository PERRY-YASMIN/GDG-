E-waste crisis management

Overview
The bin senses the level of garbage using IoT sensors(access to the level of garbage in the bin available) alerts the garbage truck systems for pickup (after the bin is 70 % full, AI predicts the time when the bin will be full and schedules the pickup time for trucks). 
All this data is stored in Cloud Iot core. 
Next part is the bin's design where the waste is segregated into firstly e-waste and non E-waste,(non e-waste is collected in the seperate detachable container and e-waste proceeds further in the bin), secondly e-waste is seperated into seperable and non seperable e-waste(non- seperable is collected elsewhere to be sent for manual labour while the seperable proceeds), thirdly it is then segregated further into 3 sections (using Iot material sensors and detectors) mainly(pure METAL, mixed metal, plastic waste left after sorting). 
Lastly
the pure metals, mixed metals are picked up by truck sent to companies with demand for metal, to recycle. While plastic is sent for recycling.
